# todo-responsive-flask
This is a Responsive and tiny attempt for making a project of TODO's List website usign Python via flask framework and sqllite as backend and its been deployed in heroku the link is    https://todo-rohan.herokuapp.com/


This is my First Approach to create a website projecrt in python with FLASK 
here i learnt to use git and heroku
for deployment and development and version control


here one more thing i leant while pushing it to github is that I learnt to push it to git used the in built command line
it was amzing

first u have to type " git remote add origin https://github.com/rohanworld/todo-responsive-flask.git "  this in the folder where u have ur projcect or (when venv is installed)

the then this " git branch -M main " to specify  it to main branch i.e. which branch it is to be pushed

and at last the D command " git push -u origin main " and thus ur work will be pushed to github

and while doing that u need to authorize git mannager to use github acces of ur account via entering the password or private authorization code or key
